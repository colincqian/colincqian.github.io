I am a student researcher at XX, supervised by Prof. . My research interests mainly lie in the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, robotics and digital humans.

I complete my master degree at ETH Zurich. During my study at ETH, I finished my master thesis on Neural Radiance Field at Adanced Interactive Technology (AIT) supervised by Prof. Otmar Hillige. I also worked as a research intern in Digital Humans Group at Disney Research Studio under the supervision of Dr. Derek Bradley and Dr. Sebastian Weiss. Prior to ETH, I did my bachelor's at Nanjing University of Aero. and Astro. I was an exchange student at Department of EECS at MIT in fall 2018 and spring 2019.
